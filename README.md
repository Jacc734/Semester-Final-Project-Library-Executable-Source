Semester-Final-Project-Library-Executable-Source
================================================

//The Library.jar file will execute by itself, and [should] create a library.txt file in the directory of its location.

//When downloaded you should seperate the Library.jar and other files from each other so for the sake of keeping things straight.

//You can delete the .jar file if you choose to download the .zip file doing so won't affect anything else.

//Program won't work properly if it is left inside the .zip file.

//The Library makes and keeps a list of items in a gui window. With the ability to loan, return, add new, or delete items.

//The program saves items to library.txt upon closing.

//It was created in Java 8
